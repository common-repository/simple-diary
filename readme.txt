A very simple diary listing user created reminders. Ready to use in WordPress default themes.

== Description ==

Simple Diary is meant to be simple enough to be used out of the box. Simple, but also powerfull and customizable. All skill user should find something to do with it.

Here's the list of the settings (see screenshots for further infos):

* Custom post type "reminder" available. The reminder infos : Title, start date (required), end date (optional), start time(optional), end time (optional), location (required), url (optionnal), article (optional). The date and time infos are set using [pickadate.js](http://amsul.ca/pickadate.js/ "Go to the pickadate.js homepage") jQuery plugin. All the system (compose reminder page and datepicker) is responsive.
* The admin reminders edit page is sorted by start date and contain title, start date, end date, location and creation/modification date. All columns are sortable except location column.
* Option page will let you modify some settings : Title of the diary page, slug modification, reminder count listed in upcoming reminders, reminder count in diary, selection of the columns in edit page.
* Possibility to add a reminder from a post (beginning with 1.3 plugin version)
* All default WordPress themes (twentyten, twentyeleven, twentytwelve, twentythirteen, twentyfourteen) can easily be updated to take in account the reminders. You just have to get archive-reminder.php, content-reminder.php or loop-reminder.php, single-reminder.php from `/simple-diary/themes-support/your_theme/` and put it into your hteme folder (`/wp-content/themes/your-theme/`). You can take these files also as examples to customize Diary and reminders for your theme.
* A "Upcoming reminders" widget is available in the admin widget section.

Simple Diary has been developed by keeping in mind following rules:

* Easy to install, use and customize
* Working on every theme (including responsive themes)
* Adding microdata used to markup HTML code for semantic (so that most popular search providers can handle the infos).
* Make it translatable (availabe languages : english and french).

For example, if you use twentyfourteen theme, you have to get the 3 files in `/simple-diary/themes-support/twentyfourteen/` folder and upload them into the `/wp-content/themes/twentyfourteen/` folder.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Where could I find the template functions of Simple Diary? =

Edit the `/simple-diary/simdiaw-template-functions.php` file, you will find all available template functions.

= I don't want to use the widget to display the upcoming reminders, is it possible? =

Yes, you can list the upcoming reminders everywhere you want, you just have to use the `the_simdiaw_upcoming_reminders()` function to get them in list format.

This code:
`&lt;ul&gt;`
   `&lt;?php the_simdiaw_upcoming_reminders(2) ?&gt;`
`&lt;/ul&gt;`
Will generate a html code like this:
`&lt;ul&gt;`
  `&lt;li&gt;Eiffel tower visiting&lt;br&gt;Date: 30/06/2014&lt;br&gt;Location: Paris&lt;/li&gt;`
  `&lt;li&gt;Storks observation&lt;br&gt;Date: 06/06/2014&lt;br&gt;Location: Obersoultzbach&lt;/li&gt;`
`&lt;/ul&gt;`

= Is this plugin compatible with Gutenberg, the new WordPress Editor? =

Yes. Beginning with 1.3 version of this plugin.

= Can I duplicate some recurrent events, reminders? =

No, sorry! But you can alternatively use the [Duplicate Post](https://fr.wordpress.org/plugins/duplicate-post/) plugin developped by [Enrico Battocchi](https://lopo.it/). I tested it and it worked fine with reminders. You just have to go to the settings of Duplicate Post and enable the custom post _reminder_ to have it work for it.

= Can I create a reminder from a post compose window? =
Yes, you can! You just have to enable this feature in the option panel, after that, you will be able to create a reminder using the link located in the Sidebar and / the admin Toolbar on a post compose (edit) window.
